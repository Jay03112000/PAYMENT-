# 💳 Payment Gateway Integration Website

A responsive and simple web project simulating a **donation-based payment system**, integrated with a basic front-end payment interface. Users can select donation amounts and payment methods (e.g. credit card, PayPal) through a clean and visually engaging UI.

---

## 🏗️ Project Description

This website demonstrates how a user flows through a basic online payment system:
1. **Homepage** with a **Donate** button
2. **Payment page** for entering amount and selecting payment type
3. **Success page** confirming the transaction

> Note: This is a front-end simulation and does not process real transactions.
